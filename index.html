        <h2>Understanding The Circulatory System:</h2>
        <img class="img" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Circulatory_System_no_tags.svg/1200px-Circulatory_System_no_tags.svg.png">
        <h3>Function</h3>
        <p>The circulatory system is in charge of delivering nutrients to the body's cells through the blood. The circulatory system primarily delivers oxygen to the body's cells, but it also transports other vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <h3>How it Works</h3>
        <p>Blood is pumped through the body's blood vessels, the arteries, veins, and capillaries, by the heart. Beginning at the heart, blood is pumped to the lungs to get oxygenized then back to the heart, where it is then pumped to the rest of the body.</p>
        <h3>Other Systems</h3>
        <p>The circulatory system works very closely with other systems such as the respiratory system and the excretory system. The circulatory system uses oxygen collected by the respiratory system to deliver to the body's cells. It also works with the excretory system by delivering excess vitamins and minerals to be removed from the body. It also takes vitamins and minerals from the excretory system that the body still needs.</p>

        <h2>What are Arteries and Veins</h2>
        <img class="img" src="https://microbiologyinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/featured-Difference-between-Arteries-and-Veins.jpg">
        <h3>Arteries</h3>
        <p>Arteries are the blood vessels than carry blood away from the heart and out to the rest of the body. To do this, arteries need to be able to constrict. Arteries have very thick walls that allow them to constrict with a lot of force, which forces the blood through the artery.</p>
        <h3>Veins</h3>
        <p>Veins are the blood vessels that return blood to the heart. Unlike arteries, veins have very thin walls that allow them to flex. Instead of constricting, veins use valves to push blood through the vein. To do this, a muscle has to squeeze the vein and push blood up past the valve then the valve closes to stop the blood from flowing backwards.</p>

        <div id="veins">
        <h2>What are Varicose Veins?</h2>
        <p>Varicose veins are what happens when blood begins to pool in the veins. This is caused by weak or damaged valves in the veins that can no longer stop blood from flowing backwards. Weak and damaged valves can be caused from old age or overuse of the valves such as standing for too long.</p>

        <div id="arteries">
        <h2>Why aren't there Varicose Arteries?</h2>
        <p>Ther aren't varicose arteries because arteries don't have any valves, they rely totally on their ability to constrict and force blood through the artery.</p>
